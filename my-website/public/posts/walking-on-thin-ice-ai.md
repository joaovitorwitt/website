What makes a topic interesting? What dictates the hype? Can we know what is going to be the next big thing in our society?

These are some of the questions that I ask myself when everybody starts talking about something, whether it is an event, a new product, or in our case… AI.

## what AI has achieved so far

Let's not waste any time here and talk about what AI has achieved so far.

Autonomous cars

Ability to answer questions naturally

Digital assistants like Alexa and Siri

Image classification

Speech recognition

So keep that in mind, dear reader, the field of AI has done a lot of stuff in the last few years. But why do we need to manage our expectations?

## don't believe the short-term hype

Expectations are a funny thing, they can be considered a double-edged sword.

On December 10th of 2020, a little game called Cyberpunk 2077 was released, saying it was going to break every record in the game industry.

If you are familiar with this story then you know exactly what happened.

The game had huge expectations around it, people were crazy to see all the revolutionary stuff that was being shown and said about the game.

But when it hit the shelves, and people got to play it was full of problems and bugs, and people’s expectations for the game crashed bigger than the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs.

That leads us to the new hype of Artificial Intelligence.

Believed it or not, this is not the first time AI is being hyped to a point of such intensity.

It all started in the 60s, with Symbolic AI.

What is Symbolic AI you may ask?

Back in the day, engineers believed that the key to creating intelligent systems was to hardcode a high number of rules within a system that eventually this system would become ‘intelligent’.

All this stuff lead to a full wave of investments, followed by disappointments

Because soon they noticed that all of this would not come true.

So companies started to stop investing in research, marking the first AI winter.

It took some years but finally, AI made its recovery.

In the 80s, a new promise came along with an array of successes, and companies started to invest again.

Oh no, they realized!

Those systems were expensive to maintain, difficult to scale into something profitable, and there was no real-world value to that. You can guess what the companies did.

But along came a method that would be known until this day, Machine Learning.

With the rise of machines, lots of data being available in digital form, computers evolving faster than a Ferrari at 200 mph, and a big research community, the field arose from the ashes as people began to see the potential behind all of that.

And today we can see all these factors combined in the form of autonomous cars, digital assistants, intelligent systems, and much more.

But we have to ask ourselves a question: How far will this go?

As I mentioned in the beginning, expectations are a funny thing when it comes to promises and optimism.

Right now the world is seeing an intense form of optimism regarding AI, but what if we are not able to go further than this with the evolution of AI? What if we are in the corner of another AI winter?

So, for the sake of all people in the world, it is best to moderate these expectations, making it crystal clear what AI can do and what AI cannot do.

With that said, I might be wrong and in 5 years AI will take all of our jobs and rule society, I guess we will never know for sure.

Enough of this, let's look at the bright side of AI, and how it can be used to solve a lot of problems that we face today in our lives.

## The Promise of AI

I think it is fair to say that the future of AI is looking pretty epic.

Maybe we can consider some of the breakthroughs in AI equal to the discovery of penicillin.

Back in the day, penicillin was crucial to saving millions of lives around the world, and it keeps saving until this day.

I mean, perhaps we can say that AI is doing the same thing on a much smaller scale.

Recently AI was used to identify a cancer cell in a patient's body, predict diseases, and also detect early signs of fatal diseases.

Great stuff, indeed.

Who knows how many lives this could save in the future?

But it is fair to point out that most of this research stuff is not 100% being used in today's world.

Your doctor doesn’t use AI, your gym doesn't use AI, and also your dentist doesn’t use AI.

But one thing we know for sure is that the Ai is coming, we don’t know when and how but it’s coming.

Today we can ask anyone on the street if they use smartphones and they probably will say yes. But get a time machine and go back 10 years, and start asking people the same question, I bet that you will find people that do not possess said technology.

Same thing with social media, today everyone uses it.

The point I am making is that stuff like this takes time to transition. Then, after that, people will start to see the potential of AI, the ability that AI has to transform the world we live in a fantastic way.

To finish up, the best thing we can do right now is see the long-term vision, and not fall for the short-term hype.
