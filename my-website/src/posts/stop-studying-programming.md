“The only way to learn new programming languages is by writing programs in it”

— Dennis Ritchie

To get started learning programming you just need four things.

Know about variables, conditions, loops, and functions.

After that you just need to write code.

You don't need a roadmap for programming, you do not need a book, or another tutorial.

Back in the day when a friend of mine started on programming he watched a 10 hour video tutorial on JavaScript.

After he finished the tutorial he came to me and said: “I finished this tutorial then i went to open the code editor and couldn't write a single line of code”.

I immediately said to him: “exactly”.

There is a term for that in the word of programming, it is called tutorial hell.

And it is the worst mistake that anyone starting in programming can make.

In fact, most people do not realize that, so let me explain the process of tutorial hell.

Imagine that you finished your 10 hours course on JavaScript, great stuff indeed, then you open a new vscode window, and just like my friend, you just cannot write code.

Tutorial hell is simply that, not being able to code without some guidance.

## How to escape

Just like Dante trying to escape the hell (or purgatory), you first will need to know the following:

Functions, variables, loops, and conditions.

Really the basics of programming. With just that you can build anything you imagine.

But how would I do that you might ask?

Well, as they say, through trial and error.
After getting the four basics out of the way you might want to pick a stack that you are interested in.

If you like front-end, pick HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and later down the road a framework.

On the other hand, if it is back-end you can choose Python, PHP, NodeJS, Rust, C#, and so on. You can also choose game development or mobile development, there are so many options available.

## The cool part

Now comes the most awesome part about all of this, you will actually write code. Wow, imagine that.

Select some project that catches your attention and try to create on your own, or replicate if it is from some tutorial.

And when you get stuck building the project, believe me you will, just search the problem and go again.

Perhaps you might need to read some documentation, or even watch a video dedicated to the problem you are facing. No shame in that, because it is you that is actually doing the heavy lifting.

You are not just copying code from some tutorial.

By doing that you will be able to test your problem solving skills, and learn from actually doing the thing.

Programming has this false feeling of learning by watching others doing, but at the end of the day you are not really learning.

You will never learn how to play some sport, by watching others playing. Programming is the same thing.
