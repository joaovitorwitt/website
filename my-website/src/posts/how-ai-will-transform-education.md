“Artificial Intelligence will be disruptive, but few people understand that education is going to be in the first frontline.”

Right now, there are two problems in education: what we teach and how we teach.

Artificial Intelligence, for some people, those words combined might induce fear, some sort of apocalyptic dystopia.

Perhaps it is because Artificial Intelligence has always been presented as a threat to human civilization.

We can just look at movies like Blade Runner, The Terminator, The Matrix, and A Space Odyssey.

What do all these movies have in common?

You are right! Some sort of advanced AI technology that becomes self-aware, and instantly represents a danger to the human race.

So as programmers and engineers, let's find out how this applies to education, what we can do to improve education and prevent potential

## Strong Implications For Better Or Worse

Chat GPT, Siri, Alexa, facial recognition, speech recognition, predicting stocks, and medical diagnoses.

Those are all a few examples of AI being implemented in its full capacity for our current time.

But we need to clarify that we don't know what AI will look like in the future. Some people say that it will improve our lives and help humanity reach a crucial point in our evolution.

While other people say that it will turn against us and wipe out all human race.

Is it not wrong to say that we are pretty much a captain navigating on the ocean for the first time, we can't be sure if we are going to find a land full of gold or else…

With all that in mind, we must carefully ask the right questions when it comes to AI in education, like:

How exactly will AI work in classrooms? How will AI affect the role of teachers? What are the short-term and long-term impact on students?

Before we even consider answering these questions, we need to get technical and look at some possible implementations of Artificial Intelligence in education environments.

## Practical Examples Of AI In Education

Let's say we create a machine learning model that can gather some data about students solving some mathematical problem, with this model we can start identifying underline misconceptions and struggles that each individual student faces.

This alone is huge, because teachers, researchers, educators will start to understand more about the process of learning and how learning can differ for each person.

But what will these learning tools look like you might ask?

For starters, one of the practical examples would be students having a one-to-one interaction with computers that provide some sort of personalized learning.

In the US, the average class size is 25, for just 1 teacher. It is fair to say that most of the time the students are not getting the necessary attention when it comes to learning.

So In this context the AI would offer personalized instructions for each student's needs.

Another problem that classrooms face is that the students have different learning paces.

Some students will find a mathematical problem easy to solve, while others might struggle to solve or not even solve at all.

How do we solve this problem?

One of the ways is to create adaptive learning systems that can dynamically adjust the learning material based on the students' performance.

This could help teachers identify sections where an individual is performing well and sections where the student struggles the most.

This alone would make an excellent impact on the student’s learning, since they would be tackling the areas where they are struggling and actually learning by doing hard things.

But again, we don't know the consequences of this, like, how we would make sure that students are on the same level?

And this raises another question: Do we need to keep students on the same level in a classroom?

For the students that are more advanced on some topic, it would be like running with some extra weight on their bodies.

Those so-called “tools” are often referred to as AIED (artificial intelligence in education) tools.

## It All Comes Full Cycle

Would be cool if we could snap a finger and all of the world's classrooms have those kinds of tools, but we know that would be impossible and we also don't know the implications for that.

What we need is a gradual implementation of these technologies. For example, Social Media usage wasn't overnight, it took some years for people to start using it on a daily basis.

AI in education wouldn't be no different, especially AI in education.

As Machine Learning Engineers, we will need to make sure the systems and models are the best version they can be since we don't know the implications of these hypothetical tools.

We also don’t know how this will affect students individually, why might work for some students more than others.

It is worth mentioning all sorts of social issues that AI might bring along, but we won't discuss them in this article, I will leave this for the experts in the subject.

Technology is evolving faster than the traditional education systems.

Today when students need to write an essay, they can just ask Chat GPT.

Why bother doing themselves when a “robot” can do a lot faster, even with poor quality. Who cares?

That's what happens when the educational system places more value in grades than in actual learning.

As a wise man once said: “I may be a madman, but I am a conscious madman”.

To begin solving this problem, we must ensure that engineers and educators come together to ensure that any AI application that will be directly involved in education is the best version possible.

It’s always nice to remember: AI is here to help humans think, not replace the thinking of humans.

And that 's all.
